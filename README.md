PC and laptop configs for Arch Linux. 

Managed using the method explained [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).

## Disclaimer

These configs are what I have personally configured over time using Arch and as such do only what I need and nothing more.
I try to keep my configs clean and self-explanatory, which is why you won't find many comments.

I wouldn't recommend trying to clone the entire repo as not all dependencies are included.
Instead, I'd recommend looking through the configs and yoinking whatever you find useful for your own dotfiles.

## What's here?

My config for i3wm, polybar, picom, and all that desktop level stuff along with the terminal applications I use.

Feel free to open issues for anything. I'm open to suggestions.
