PC and laptop configs for Arch Linux

## Future plans

### General
Switch to wayland (sway + waybar), when it's more stable/supported.

### Laptop
Make a KDE branch.

### Vim/Neovim
- Setup some sort of debugging/inspector solution (vimspector?)
- Make some bindings for vim-fugitive
- Support running tests?
